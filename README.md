Random batch files and commands lists of things I regularly use within Windows or Android  
Hopefully helpful to others  

Some things are batch files to make things easier that are complex or repetitive, with very specific use cases  
Some may just be a copy & paste list of things I reference and run often  
Some are notes of what to do in certain one-off situations I encountered  

A quick timestamper batch file  
A quick adb device connector/opener batch file to automate browsing  
An uptime checker batch file  
local commands for testing nfcscreenoff and nfcscreenoffpatcher on windows
